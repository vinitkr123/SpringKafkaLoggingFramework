# Updated Requirements Analysis for Spring Kafka Logging Framework

## New Requirements

Based on the user's feedback, the following additional requirements need to be implemented:

### 1. Dedicated Log File
- The framework should generate a dedicated log file specifically for the logs captured by this framework
- This log file should be separate from the application's main log file
- Users should be able to configure the location and name of this log file

### 2. Comprehensive Logging
- The framework should capture both logs from the consuming application and errors
- All relevant information from the consuming application should be logged
- Error states should be clearly marked in the logs

### 3. Method Status Tracking
- The framework should track the execution status of methods (passed/failed)
- If a method completes without exceptions, it should be marked as "PASSED"
- If a method throws an exception, it should be marked as "FAILED"
- This status should be clearly visible in the log entries

### 4. Configurable Method Selection
- Users should be able to configure exactly which methods they want to log
- The configuration should be flexible and easy to use
- Methods not specified in the configuration should not be logged

## Implementation Approach

### Dedicated Log File Implementation
- Use a separate logger configuration for the framework
- Implement a custom appender that writes to a dedicated file
- Allow configuration of file path, name, and rotation policy

### Method Status Tracking
- Enhance the AOP aspects to track method execution status
- Add status field to the LoggingEvent model
- Update the logging format to include the status information

### Enhanced Configuration System
- Expand the existing configuration properties
- Add more granular method selection options
- Provide both annotation-based and property-based configuration

### Integration with Existing Framework
- Maintain backward compatibility with the existing implementation
- Ensure the new features work seamlessly with the current framework
- Update all relevant components to support the new requirements
