# Spring Kafka Logging Framework - Requirements Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the requirements for creating a logging framework in Spring that will log Kafka logs from consumer applications without requiring them to modify their codebase.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Predefined Function Logging
- The framework must be able to log data from a set of predefined functions
- These functions should be intercepted automatically without modifying the consumer application code
- The interception should capture:
  - Method name
  - Input parameters
  - Return values
  - Execution time
  - Kafka message details (topic, partition, offset)

### 2. Configurable Custom Function Logging
- Consumer applications should be able to add configuration to log functions beyond the predefined set
- This configuration should be external (properties file, annotations, or Spring configuration)
- The configuration should allow specifying:
  - Which additional methods to log
  - What level of detail to log
  - Custom log formats if needed

### 3. Exception Handling and Logging
- The framework must log any exceptions that occur in the consumer application
- Exception logging should include:
  - Exception type
  - Exception message
  - Stack trace
  - Kafka message that caused the exception
  - Context information (method, parameters)

### 4. Non-invasive Integration
- The framework must work without requiring changes to the consumer application's code
- It should be includable as a dependency with minimal configuration

## Technical Approach

### Spring AOP for Method Interception
- Use Spring AOP to intercept method calls in the consumer application
- Define pointcuts for predefined functions
- Allow configurable pointcuts for custom function logging
- Use @Around advice to capture method execution details

### Exception Handling Mechanism
- Use @AfterThrowing advice to capture exceptions
- Implement a global exception handler for Kafka listeners
- Consider using ErrorHandler in Kafka listener container factory

### Configuration System
- Provide annotation-based configuration for custom logging
- Support property-based configuration for external configuration
- Allow for programmatic configuration through Spring beans

### Integration with Kafka
- Intercept Kafka listener methods
- Extract Kafka message details from ConsumerRecord or Acknowledgment objects
- Consider integration with Spring Kafka's listener container factory

## Additional Considerations

### Performance Impact
- Logging should have minimal impact on application performance
- Consider asynchronous logging for high-throughput applications
- Provide configuration for log levels to control verbosity

### Log Format and Storage
- Support multiple log formats (text, JSON)
- Allow configuration of log destinations (file, console, external systems)
- Consider integration with existing logging frameworks (Log4j, Logback)

### Monitoring and Metrics
- Collect metrics on logged events
- Provide integration with monitoring systems
- Consider exposing metrics through Spring Actuator

### Security Considerations
- Provide mechanisms to mask sensitive data in logs
- Allow configuration of what data should be logged
- Consider compliance requirements (GDPR, etc.)
